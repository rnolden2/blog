### About Me

Currently a professional sales engineer experienced in project management whose main focus is to ensure premier customer satisfaction. I service the aerospace industry, both commercial and defense and utilize Data Science to tackle industry related business problems. I'm a self-starter always eager to learn new skills. 

### Industry-related Projects

* Price Prediction
* Customer Clustering
* Scheduling Assest
* 
* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Training Projects

In addition to real-world projects I have worked on here are a few training projects I have completed. 

* Product Recommendation System
* Device Failures
* Twitter Sentiment
* Advance Housing Prices
* 
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

### Skillset

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
